Overall goal:
George:
1. Controller documentation (Done)
2. CUDA code for part 1: roughly ran on CPU to check that the basic logic is correct with directly input, no actual LLM run on it yet
3. CUDA code for part 2: not implement yet

Sam: 
1. Selective KVRC + FC
3. Test cases

Tom:
1. Selective KVRC + FC
2. Documentation

2025 07 25 Meeting:
George: Base on the documentation, write CUDA code that can run part 1 of the controller, and run it on autoDL to test the functionility or run it on a CUDA simulator to test the functionility.
Sam & Tom: complete the interface document for selective & FC section, Improve the feasibility of selective & FC code. If able to complete the code in time, test it on autoDL server or local graphic card.
