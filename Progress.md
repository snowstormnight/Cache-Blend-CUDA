Overall goal:
George:
1. Controller documentation (Done)
2. CUDA code for part 1: roughly ran on CPU to check that the basic logic is correct with directly input, no actual LLM run on it yet
3. CUDA code for part 2: not implement yet



2025 07 25 Meeting:
George: Base on the documentation, write CUDA code that can run part 1 of the controller, and run it on autoDL to test the functionility or run it on a CUDA simulator to test the functionility.
